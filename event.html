        <img src="event5.jpeg" alt="Event 1 Image" class="event-image">
        <p class="event-description">International Center for Theoretical Physics, Physics Without Frontiers working with the University of Sussex,
             and DISCnet are organising a 5-day intensive workshop in Symmetries, Data Science, and AI for Physicists for over 90 physics students of Sherubtse College.
            <br> <br>
            The workshop was scheduled from 25th to 29th March. It consisted of lectures in the morning, followed by hands-on sessions in the afternoons 
            where participants be analysed Open Data from the ATLAS experiment at CERN and had problem solving sessions. The participants learned about particle 
            physics and symmetries, gained analytical skills, and were given an introduction to Machine Learning (ML), and to use ML to search for Dark Matter in ATLAS 
            proton collision data. There was also a careers and opportunities session, and the participants  gave presentations at the end and received certificates.
            <br> <br>
            The workshop was taught by Dr Kate Shaw (ICTP, University of Sussex), Dr Mick Taylor (Universityof Sussex), and Sr Andrea Banfi (University of Sussex), 
            and coordinated by Mon Badadur Ghalley (Sherubtse College, The Royal University of Bhutan).
            <br> <br>
            By actively engaging in the workshop, students  gained the skills to effectively employ advanced data science and computational tools in the field of physics.
             They also developed an understanding of the significance of symmetries in physics, thereby strengthening their ability to conduct scientific analysis, modelling, and problem-solving on a global level.</p>
